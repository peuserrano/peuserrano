# Pedro Serrano

Data Scientist with strong foundations in statistics, econometrics, and 
quantitative modeling, building toward ML engineering.

I design data pipelines and analytical systems end-to-end, combining 
statistical rigor with clean, reproducible engineering. My work focuses 
on extracting reliable signals from real-world data and building robust 
analytical workflows.

I'm particularly interested in problems that operate at scale and require 
both methodological depth and strong engineering foundations.
